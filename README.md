# 🎓 UBIT Semester II — OOPs Lab Tasks

This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab tasks completed during **Semester II at UBIT**. The focus is on solidifying core OOP principles using **Java** and selected exercises in **Python**, aligned with weekly lab work and university curriculum.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Apply **OOP fundamentals**: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Develop proficiency in **Java** for object modeling and design
- Explore **Python** to contrast OOP across languages
- Practice clean coding, reusability, and modularity
- Prepare for practical lab exams and real-world OOP scenarios

---

> This repository will be updated weekly to reflect all lab sessions

## 📁 Directory Structure

Here is the clean and properly formatted **directory structure** for your `Ubit_Semester_II_OOPs_LabTasks` repository, based on the structure you’ve provided:

```
Ubit_Semester_II_OOPs_LabTasks/
├── Week_05/
│   ├── Java Version/
│   │   ├── Triangle.java
│   │   └── Main.java
│   │
│   ├── Python Version/
│   │   ├── Class/
│   │   │   └── Triangle.py
│   │   └── Main.java
│
├── Week_06/              # Placeholder for future labs
│   └── README.md
```

### 📌 Notes:

* You may want to rename `Main.java` inside the **Python Version** directory if it was mistakenly placed there.
* `Week_06/README.md` should eventually explain lab content for that week.

Let me know if you want this as part of your README or visualized with icons or Markdown checklists.

> Ensure you have **Java JDK (11+)** and **Python 3.10+** installed.
