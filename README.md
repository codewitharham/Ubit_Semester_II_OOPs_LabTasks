- Understand and apply key OOP principles: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**
- Develop object-oriented solutions using **Java**
- Explore Python’s object-oriented capabilities
- Practice clean, reusable, and modular code
- Prepare for lab evaluations and real-world problem solving

## 📁 Directory Structure

The following outlines the current project structure:

```

Ubit\_Semester\_II\_OOPs\_LabTasks/
├── Week\_05/
│   ├── Java Version/
│   │   ├── Triangle.java
│   │   └── Main.java
│   │
│   ├── Python Version/
│   │   ├── Class/

> 📝 **Note:**  
> - You may want to rename `Main.java` in the **Python Version** folder if it was added by mistake.  
> - The `Week_06/README.md` should eventually explain the objectives and tasks for that week.
